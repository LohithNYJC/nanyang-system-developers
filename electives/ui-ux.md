# User Interface and Experience (UI/UX)

## Overview

UI/UX design focuses on creating intuitive and engaging interfaces that provide a positive user experience.

## Key Concepts

- **User Interface (UI)**: The visual elements of a product that users interact with, such as buttons, icons, and menus.
- **User Experience (UX)**: The overall experience a user has with a product, including usability, accessibility, and satisfaction.
- **Wireframing**: Creating a basic visual guide to the structure and layout of a user interface.
- **Prototyping**: Building an interactive model of a product to test and refine design concepts.
