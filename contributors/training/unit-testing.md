# Unit Testing

## Overview

Unit testing involves testing individual components of software to ensure they work as expected. It helps in identifying bugs early, simplifies debugging, and improves code quality.

## Notes

See [the chapter on Testing](https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vQsjAfv74CzXyodYtiaJWPyUp5T3zOWllbCiYI4vfmJP779Anci2FnWJ_tVgfXMbjrG4MeVjYeZMtSu/pub#h.jdyuacb9pkys) on the types of test cases required for good coverage.

See [Testing with unittest](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRmUuBq1CtweNEvxAnr90uM4dE-wgAYrfgQErOQUPgM-9YgcZAbKykhHuOXPCoR0oigpZMsCMEXuqc2/pub) to understand how to use the [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) module in Python for writing unit tests.

Python also has other third-party packages for unit testing, such as [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/).
