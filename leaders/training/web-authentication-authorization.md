# Web Authentication and Authorization

## Overview

Authentication and authorization are critical components of web security, ensuring that users are who they claim to be and have the appropriate access rights.

## Key Concepts

- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of a user, typically through credentials like usernames and passwords.
- **Authorization**: Granting or denying access to resources based on the user's identity and permissions.
- **OAuth**: An open standard for access delegation, commonly used for token-based authentication.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.

## Best Practices

- Use strong, unique passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions.
- Regularly review and update access controls.
- Use secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS) to protect data in transit.
