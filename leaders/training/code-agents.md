# Code Agents

## Overview

Code agents are autonomous programs that perform tasks such as code analysis, generation, and refactoring to assist developers.

## Key Concepts

- **Static Analysis**: Examining code without executing it to find potential errors and improve quality.
- **Code Generation**: Automatically creating code based on predefined templates or patterns.
- **Refactoring**: Restructuring existing code to improve readability, maintainability, and performance without changing its behavior.
- **AI-Powered Tools**: Using artificial intelligence to enhance code completion, error detection, and optimization.

## Best Practices

- Integrate code agents into your development workflow to automate repetitive tasks.
- Regularly review and update the rules and patterns used by code agents.
- Use code agents to enforce coding standards and best practices.
- Continuously monitor the performance and accuracy of AI-powered tools.
