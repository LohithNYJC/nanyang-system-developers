# DevOps

## Overview

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software continuously.

## Key Concepts

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automatically integrating code changes into a shared repository and running tests to detect issues early.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: Automating the deployment process to ensure that code changes can be released to production reliably and quickly.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managing and provisioning infrastructure through code rather than manual processes.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Continuously monitoring applications and infrastructure to detect and resolve issues proactively.

## Best Practices

- Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment.
- Use IaC tools (e.g., Terraform, Ansible) to manage infrastructure.
- Foster a culture of collaboration and communication between development and operations teams.
- Continuously monitor and optimize the performance and reliability of applications.
