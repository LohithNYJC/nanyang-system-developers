# Dependency Management

## Overview

Dependency management involves handling the libraries and frameworks that a project relies on to ensure compatibility, security, and maintainability.

## Key Concepts

- **Versioning**: Using version numbers to track changes and updates to dependencies.
- **Package Managers**: Tools that automate the process of installing, updating, and removing dependencies (e.g., npm, pip, Maven).
- **Semantic Versioning**: A versioning scheme that conveys meaning about the underlying changes (e.g., MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
- **Transitive Dependencies**: Dependencies of dependencies that need to be managed to avoid conflicts and ensure compatibility.

## Best Practices

- Use a lock file to ensure consistent dependency versions across different environments.
- Regularly update dependencies to benefit from security patches and new features.
- Monitor for and address security vulnerabilities in dependencies.
- Document and review the dependencies used in your project.
